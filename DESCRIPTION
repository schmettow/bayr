Title: tidy and unified reporting of Bayesian regression results

Description: This package aims at unifying tool set for reporting of
    Bayesian regression models (generalized linear mixed-effects models).
    A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of MCMC chains
    from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: brms, rstanarm).
    Posterior distributions are stored in	a common annotated long format
    with classified parameters to facilitate further
    processing with dplyr/tidyr and ggplot2. Reporting functions
    for posteriors, posterior predictions and coefficient tables are 
    provided that integrate well with markup documents.
