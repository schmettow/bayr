Description: This package aims at unifying tool set for reporting of
    Bayesian regression models (generalized linear mixed-effects models).
    A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of MCMC chains
    from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: brms, rstanarm).
    Posterior distributions are stored in annotated long format.
    Parameters are classified to facilitate further
    processing with dplyr/tidyr and ggplot2. Reporting functions
    for posteriors, posterior predictions, coefficient tables and 
    infomration criteriaare provided that integrate well with markup 
    documents.
