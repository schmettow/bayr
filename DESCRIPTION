Title: dplyr/tidyr based manipulation of MCMC chains
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2016-03-07
Author: Martin Schmettow
Maintainer: Martin Schmettow <schmettow@web.de>
Description: This package aims at unifying tool set for reporting
		of Bayesian regression models (generalized linear mixed-effects models).
		A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of MCMC chains
		from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: MCMCglmm, brms).
		Posterior distributions are stored in	a common annotated long format
		to facilitate further processing with dplyr/tidyr and ggplot2.
		Basic summary functions for coefficient tables are provided.
