Title: unified reporting of Bayesian regression results
Version: 0.5

Description: This package aims at unifying tool set for reporting of
		Bayesian regression models (generalized linear mixed-effects models).
		A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of MCMC chains
		from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: MCMCglmm, brms).
		Posterior distributions are stored in	a common annotated long format
		to facilitate further processing with dplyr/tidyr and ggplot2.
		Basic summary functions for coefficient tables are provided.
