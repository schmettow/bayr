Description: This package aims at unifying tool set for reporting of
		Bayesian regression models (generalized linear mixed-effects models).
		A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of MCMC chains
		from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: brms, rstanarm).
		Posterior distributions are stored in	a common annotated long format
		with classified parameters to facilitate further
		processing with dplyr/tidyr and ggplot2.
		Basic summary functions for coefficient tables are provided.
