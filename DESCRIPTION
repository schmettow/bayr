Title: tidy and unified reporting of Bayesian regression models
Version: 0.9.6
Date: 2022-05-29
Author: Martin Schmettow
Maintainer: Martin Schmettow <schmettow@web.de>
Description: This package makes reporting of Bayesian New Statistics models 
    easy. A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of parameter estimates 
    from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: brms and rstanarm).
    Posterior distributions are stored in an unified long format, so 
    that customized output tables and plots can be produced with tidy 
    processing chains. A set of methods makes extraction of parameter estimates,
    predictions and information criteria easy, tidy and good looking in 
    Knitr/Markdown reports.
