Title: tidy and unified reporting of Bayesian regression models

Description: This package makes reporting of Bayesian New Statistics models 
    easy. A set of wrapper functions unifies extraction of MCMC chains
    from varios Bayesian implementations (currently: brms, rstanarm, and some lme4).
    Posterior distributions are stored in annotated long format.
    Parameters are classified to facilitate further
    processing with dplyr/tidyr and ggplot2. The reporting functions
    for posteriors, posterior predictions, coefficient tables and 
    information criteria all work well with knitr/markdown documents.
