\value{
tbl_post object with MCMC chain in long format or tbl.df in wide shape

The MCMC chains are extracted from the model and stored in a
common format. Different to most internal representations, and
mcmc objects from package coda, the chains are stored in a
long table with the following columns:

\description{
MCMC chains are  extracted from a Bayesian (regression) object
and returned as a posterior object, which is in long format
(chain, iter, parameter, value, type, order). Parameters are classified
as fixef, ranef, grpef and named after a common scheme.
